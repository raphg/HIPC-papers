Outline of HIPC Statistics and Bioinformatics Immunology Introductory Paper
===========================================================================

*The phrase “HIPC technology” refers to data common among HIPC members and immunology researchers such as gene expression microarrays, multiplexed flow cytometry, genotype, cytokine expression, antibody titer and high-throughput proteomics
